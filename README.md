# Overview

This is a simple crafting system for a future 2d rpg game.

It is built in C# using Unity and should work out-the-box.


## Player Control

Move using arrow keys or WASD
- E to interact with crafting stations
- I to log inventory contents
- F adds materials for smelting to the inventory (for testing purposes)


## TODOs
- Proper inventory UI, 
- Improve crafting UI looks
- More materials and stations
- Fix craft button so it displays correctly


## For Assessor
Hi Jason!

Version control can be seen in releases, currently on v0.1
Version control history is in history, obviously
Main logic is in Assets/Scripts
